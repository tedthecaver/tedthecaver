In this level we are told the password is stored in the readme file in the home directory. A problem arises when upon logging in with ssh we are immediately booted out...

Ok let us look at the login page. `ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220`

We are booted immediately. Maybe we can use the telnet protocol to login? Telnet doesn't provide the encryption that ssh does but the login problem might be with ssh.
