In this level we are told the password is stored in the readme file in the home directory. A problem arises when upon logging in with ssh we are immediately booted out...

Ok let us look at the login page. `ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220`

We are booted immediately. Maybe we can use the telnet protocol to login? Telnet doesn't provide the encryption that ssh does but the login problem might be with ssh. `telnet bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220`

For the uninintiated telnet and ssh are two protocols that allow you to connect to another server over the internet or network. Telnet sends your information in plaintext meaning that your username and password are easily visible whereas ssh encrypts this information. Think of logging into a website where you enter a username and password, that usually uses a protcol called https and this works similar to ssh and telnet. 

Alright back to the problem at hand, we are using the wrong format for a telnet login but the problem lies within the bash shell so switching protocols shouldn't be the fix. Let's stick with ssh and try adding something else to the command.... how about removing the .bashrc file? This is the file that is logging us out so perhaps removing it will solve our problems?
